    <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>This is a recipe for chicken biryani I pulled off the internet.</p>
    <p><strong>Full disclosure: I have never tried this recipe in my life.</strong></p>
    <p>It may turn out great but honestly nothing can beat my mother's biryani, the recipe for which I won't share because it's very special and closely guarded.  Sorry to disappoint you guys.  Love you, ma!</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Rice</li>
        <li>Spices</li>
        <li>Lamb</li>
        <li>Rest of the biryani recipe</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Turn on the stove to the right temperature</li>
    <li>Put the desired amount of rice in a pot</li>
    <li>Put the pot on the stove, preferably on the lit one</li>
    <li>Put the right amount of water in</li>
    <li>Cook the rice the right way</li>
        <li>something happens with the beef and spice but I'm not sure I'll check later and lyk</li>
    <li>When the rice is done, turn it into biryani</li>
    <li>Serve, or don't and eat it yourself.  It's your biryani, you can do whatever you want with it.</li>
    </ol>
